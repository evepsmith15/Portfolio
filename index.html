                <p>First week was stressful but things can only get better from here. I graduated from the University of Washington with a degree in history. 
                  I'm a hermit so I spend more time indoors then out. I prefer colder seasons where I can bundle underneath a blanket.
                  I enjoy writing and playing video games. I don't have a fondness for dogs but prefer cats.
                  I suck at platforming and shooter games. I can't play horror games without getting jumpy. My best genre is the RPG and tactical games that require thinking instead of reflexes.
                  When I write, readers tend to complain that I'm overly complicated with my plots when I'm writing anything that isn't humor. However, I put more detail into my stories than most.
                </p>
                <p>I live in Mount Vernon Washington which is 2 hour away from the BootCamp. Traffic is terrible more times than not. Returnng home is worse. I work after class. 
                  I work as a candy merchandiser. Sometimes, my boss makes me do projects outside of candy. Some assignments are routine while others aren't. My schedule is very flexible. 
                  I still need to clock in and report my time even if VOLT doesn't want to work half the time.
